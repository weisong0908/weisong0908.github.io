AM Buddy is a mobile application built for SingHealth institutions that serves as a companion app service to assist patients by providing them personalised medical guidelines. With this mobile app, patients can easily interact with medical staff by referring to information issued to them and monitor their health statuses from time to time. The project includes a web dashboard built with Strapi (a Node.js based CMS) and hosted with AWS.
