Simple App is a residential property management mobile and web application that is developed for Simply, a managing agent based in Singapore (see [here](https://simplysakal.asia) for their website). It provides a convenient and simplified platform for condominium administrators to manage their properties, interact with respective residents, and monitor daily activities. I am in charged of building the web backend using Hapi (a Node.js web backend framework), MySQL database, and AWS for hosting.
