---

My name is Teng Wei Song. I am currently working in Singapore as a full-time software developer who builds both websites and web applications. As both **AWS Certified Solutions Architecture Associate** and **ScrumAlliance Certified ScrumMaster**, I am not only able to code software products, but also provide web solutions, design cloud architectures, and manage projects with Scrum.

My main skills in web development include building web backend using both .NET and Node.js frameworks as well as frontend using Sitefinity, Vue.js, and Nuxt.js. C# and JavaScript/TypeScript are two programming languages that I use. The myraid of skills that I possess allows me to be well-rounded and offer multiple ideas.
