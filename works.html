              This project is a revamped website for Ministry of Finance of
              Singapore. The website is built on Sitefinity CMS with various
              customisations that extend the basic out-of-the-box functions.

              This project is a document control system designed for Curtin
              Singapore to ensure existence of controlled processes and
              practices for the creation, review, modification, issuance,
              distribution, and accessibility of documents. It is an improvement
              project to replace the existing manual process.

              The following table shows the improvement this project can bring
              to the existing manual document control system processes.

                    spreadsheet and duplicate the documents in respective
                    folders in shared drive.

              The project consists of both front and back ends in a multi-layer
              architecture. Due to the restriction of company policy, both
              project front and back ends were combined into one WPF
              application. The MVVM (model-view-view model) pattern is adopted.

                    There is no plan to have a dedicated server, therefore the
                    viable option is to use the Microsoft Access which is placed
                    and shared in company shared drive. Migration to use SQL
                    Server or PostgreSQL can be easy done as the layers are
                    dependent on abstraction.

              This project is created as a simple real-time chat application
              that allows users to sign up and chat with each other. The
              intention is to build a chat application that does not require
              friends adding - chat is public, like in a coffee shop.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vue is used as the front-end component of the application because
              single page application is fast and more suitable for web
              applications. The back-end component is build with ASP.NET Core
              Web API, which uses SignalR to achieve real-time data transfering.
            </p>
            <p>
              Auth0 is used as identity service provider for user authentication
              and authorisation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Docker, combined with Github Actions, is used to achieve
              continuous integration and continuous deployment (CICD). With the
              process set up, upon receiving new commits on certain branch,
              Github builds the code, prepares docker image, pushes the docker
              image to Docker Hub, accesses to server through SSH, pulls the
              Docker image, and finally runs it. This allows my changes are seen
              immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              The application is hosted on my server using NGINX as reverse
              proxy.

              Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in
              software design. Each of these used as a blueprint or base that
              can be further customised to suit unique requirement.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project consists of examples of the most popular design
              patterns and is written in C#. It is usually used as my reference
              point or source of inspiration.
